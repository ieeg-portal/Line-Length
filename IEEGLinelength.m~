function IEEGLinelength(dataset, winL, varargin)
  %IEEGLINELENGTH  Calculates line length on an IEEGDataset object.
  %   IEEGLINELENGTH(DATASET, WINL) calculates the line length on all
  %   channels in DATASET. It stores the linelength of non-overlapping
  %   windows in a binary file (default: 'LL_Results.bin'). WINL is a
  %   numeric that indicates the number of samples that should be included
  %   in the Line Length calculation window. 
  %
  %   Use the READLLRESULTS method to read the binary results file into
  %   MATLAB.
  %
  %   Some optional arguments can be provided to specify the behavior of
  %   the algorithm. Each argument should be followed by the new value of
  %   the argumant.
  %
  %   'channels'    [1xn] vector of channel indices in the dataset that
  %                 should be analyzed.
  %   'blockSize'   Approximate block size in microseconds requested from
  %                 portal per loop. 
  %   'maxIter'     Maximum number of blocks that will be fetched from
  %                 the Portal. Use this to specify duration of the
  %                 analysis.
  %   'outputFile'  String with name of file that should be used to
  %                 store the results.
  %   'overlap'     Boolean that indicates whether the results should use
  %                 overlapping windows or not (default FALSE).
  %
  %
  %   For Example:
  %       IEEGLinelength(dataset, 800, 'channels', ...
  %                         1:16, 'noOverlap', false);
  %
  %   See Also: READLLRESULTS
  
  % To read line length from Binary file:
  %   >> fid = fopen('filename','r');
  %   >> data = fread(fid, 'double');
  %   >> data = reshape(data, nrChannels,[]);
